minimalist (opinionated) unifi controller container
===================================================

There are (many) other UnifiÂ® Controller containers, you might want
those; this was created as a local migration strategy without looking
too much at the alternatives.

Here we have:

 * debian (stretch-slim) + unifi
 * config & db as volumes
 * a small startup/entrypoint script
